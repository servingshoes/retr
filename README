I've created this small framework to help myself in scraping. So it's basically suits my needs and I don't know about yours.

It support multiple threads and rotating proxies. It has filter class to run against the raw lists (for example from gatherproxy.com), filtering out buggy or timing out proxies so they won't slow the scrape.
